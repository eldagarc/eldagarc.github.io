Idea: When I was younger I remember watching the movie Clueless and being so mesmerized  by the idea of someoneâ€™s having a virtual closet / outfit maker / previewer. 
There are so many instances where I am getting ready / or will plan an outfit out in my head, try it on, hate it, and then am stuck with a mess of clothes in my room. I think 
this would not only be fun, but it would also benefit the person / save them from making a mess. 

I am hoping to publish this project. And will keep a log to document progress / issues that I come across along the way!
